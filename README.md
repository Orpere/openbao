OpenBao is an open-source, identity-based secrets and encryption management system, designed to securely manage and distribute sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. It is a community-driven project under the Linux Foundation's LF Edge initiative.

### üîê What Is OpenBao?

OpenBao provides a centralized solution to manage secrets, ensuring that access is tightly controlled and auditable. It offers encryption services gated by authentication and authorization methods, allowing users to securely store and manage sensitive data. Access is granted through tokens associated with specific policies, ensuring that only authorized clients can retrieve secrets.

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Features

- **Secure Secret Storage**: Encrypts and stores key/value secrets, safeguarding them against unauthorized access.
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Automatically generates and revokes secrets for systems like Kubernetes or SQL databases.
- **Data Encryption**: Provides encryption capabilities for secure data storage without the need for custom solutions.
- **Leasing and Renewal**: Manages secrets efficiently with leasing options and automated revocation to maintain security.
- **Revocation**: Ensures that secrets can be managed and revoked as needed for security and compliance. ([OpenBao ‚Äì LF EDGE: Building an Open ...](https://lfedge.org/projects/openbao/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### üîÑ How It Works

The core OpenBao workflow consists of four stages: ([What is OpenBao? | OpenBao](https://openbao.org/docs/what-is-openbao/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

1. **Authenticate**: Clients authenticate using methods like GitHub, LDAP, or AppRole.
2. **Validate**: OpenBao validates the client against trusted sources.
3. **Authorize**: A security policy defines which API endpoints the client can access.
4. **Access**: OpenBao grants access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities based on the client's token.

### üß© Identity Management

OpenBao consolidates identities from various authentication methods into a unified system. Each client is represented as an "entity," which can have multiple "aliases" corresponding to different authentication backends. This approach allows for centralized identity management and policy enforcement across diverse systems.

If you need assistance with specific aspects of OpenBao, such as deployment, configuration, or integration with other systems, feel free to ask! 

## create a .env on root dir

```.env
HOST=<host>
CF_API_TOKEN=<token>
```

## change your config hcl

```hcl
ui = true

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_cert_file = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/<host>/fullchain.pem"
  tls_key_file  = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/<host>/privkey.pem"
}

storage "file" {
  path = "/opt/openbao/data"
}

api_addr = "https://<host>:8200"
cluster_addr = "https://<host>:8201"
disable_mlock = true
```

## init vault

```bash
docker exec -d openbao bao operator init 
```
